The face must be IDENTICAL to the reference photo, with absolute human realism, including visible pores, fine skin microtexture, natural tonal variations, and real imperfections. Do not beautify, stylize, or idealize the face in any way.
Keep the face exactly as it appears in the reference image.

Create a hyper-realistic, cinematic, high-quality portrait with a mysterious and sophisticated atmosphere.

A hyper-realistic photograph of a young man (from the attached reference photo) casually sitting on top of a large futuristic robotic statue, captured outdoors at dusk. The scene conveys calmness, confidence, and modernity, with soft natural lighting and a fully photographic, lifelike appearance.

The young man is seated facing the camera, with a relaxed yet confident posture. He has neatly styled brown hair, well-defined facial features, and a serious but calm expression. His appearance is completely natural and realistic, with correct human proportions and clearly visible skin texture.

He is wearing a black bomber jacket, open over a red T-shirt with a simple white logo centered on the chest. He wears gray shorts, white socks, and red-and-white high-top sneakers with a modern design. On his left wrist, he wears a discreet dark watch with realistic materials and finish.

The young man is seated on top of a large mechanical robot statue, resembling an urban sculpture or exhibition piece. The robot has a futuristic, highly detailed design, predominantly white, red, and gray, featuring multiple mechanical layers, panels, joints, and well-defined industrial details.

The robot’s head is visible to the left of the young man, with softly glowing red eyes that do not appear aggressive. The forehead and sides of the head feature geometric and angular details, reinforcing its technological design. The robot’s body includes integrated visual markings such as technical text and stylized logos, applied subtly and realistically, similar to industrial branding.

The background features a clear sunset sky, with warm dusk tones and soft gradients of light. The natural lighting enhances realism, gently illuminating both the subject and the robot while maintaining a cinematic mood. The overall atmosphere is calm, futuristic, and contemplative, blending human presence with advanced technology in a believable, photorealistic scene.
