Keep the faces in the reference image.
A cinematic urban portrait of me, keeping my real face unchanged. I am sitting casually on outdoor stone steps in front of a building entrance, leaning slightly forward with a confident and contemplative posture. My left elbow rests on my knee, with my hand raised to my temple in a thoughtful gesture, while my right arm hangs more loosely, with my hand extended downward in a relaxed position. My legs are bent naturally, spreading apart for a grounded and strong presence. My gaze is directed toward the camera, steady and intense, with a calm yet powerful expression. I am wearing a black outfit: a fitted turtleneck sweater layered under a black coat with a wide collar and subtle texture. The coat has a tailored yet modern look, with a slightly matte fabric that absorbs the light, creating depth. My trousers are also black, slim-fitted, completing the clean, monochromatic style. No visible accessories, emphasizing minimalism and sophistication.
The background shows part of an urban building with glass doors and warm interior lights softly glowing, adding contrast to the darker tones of my outfit. The lighting is warm and diffused, highlighting my face and upper body while creating soft shadows that add cinematic depth. The camera captures me slightly from below (low angle), emphasizing strength and presence, framed from the knees up. The focal length resembles a portrait lens around 50-85mm, producing natural proportions with a shallow depth of field that keeps me sharp against the softly blurred background. Style: cinematic, moody urban portrait, editorial fashion photography, minimalistic monochrome outfit, professional model vibe.
