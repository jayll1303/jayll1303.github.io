Keep the faces in the reference image. Using the uploaded image create a 
Ultra-realistic 9:16 vertical format fisheye selfie of me riding
a white road bicycle at high speed on a down slop
road surrounded by green grass side of the coaltar road and trees. The
person looks extremely shocked and scared, while being
chased by three aggressive dogs running behind them.
One of the dogs is leaping mid-air with its mouth open.
The scene is full of motion blur and dust and mist to emphasize the
speed and urgency. The road bicycle is tilting slightly, and the
person's wearing riding jerseys, helmet, sunglasses and a slim thin open wind breaker on the jerseys which flapping in the wind. Replace the
original rider's face with the uploaded image, keeping
expression's exaggerated for comic effect. Ensure the
lighting, skin tone, and facial angles match naturally.
High camera angle. Extreme fisheye distortion.
Realistic, cinematic lighting, anime characters integrated
with stylized realism.
